# scss-color-palettes
Experimental color palette generator using SCSS and bourbon

## What is it
Pass in a color and get a color scale to use in your design

## Try it out
Sorry I didn't set up any build scripts or anything. You'll need sass installed globally, then on the command line run:  
`sass --watch scss.scss:styles.css`
